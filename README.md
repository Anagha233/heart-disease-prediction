#  Medisen – Heart Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview
Medisen is an automated medical diagnosis system designed to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques.  
The system helps patients check their heart condition online and allows them to book appointments with doctors.  
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning classification algorithms in the healthcare domain for early heart disease detection.

##  Objective of the Study
The objective of this study is to predict heart disease using an automated medical diagnosis system based on machine learning.  
The system uses an efficient machine learning classification model, which is one of the best approaches for heart disease prediction.  
The goal is to support early diagnosis and improve accessibility to medical consultation.

##  System Users
The Medisen system has **two main users**:

- **Patient**
- **Doctor**

---

##  Patient Module
A patient is an individual who visits the website to check their heart condition.  
The patient can predict heart disease and book an appointment with a doctor.

### Main functionalities of the Patient:
1. **Check Heart Condition**  
   - Enter medical details  
   - Get heart disease prediction using a machine learning model  

2. **View Doctor**  
   - View available doctors  

3. **Book Appointment**  
   - Book an appointment with a selected doctor  

---

##  Doctor Module
The doctor can view the patients who have booked appointments through the system.

### Main functionality of the Doctor:
1. **View Bookings**  
   - View appointment details of patients  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Classification Algorithm  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite  

---

##  How the System Works
1. Patient enters medical details
2. Data is processed and sent to the ML model
3. The model predicts the presence or absence of heart disease
4. Patient can view doctors and book an appointment
5. Doctor can view patient bookings

---

##  Future Enhancements
- Improve prediction accuracy using advanced algorithms
- Add more medical parameters
- Enable online consultation
- Deploy the system on cloud
